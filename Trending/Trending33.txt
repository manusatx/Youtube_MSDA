oh wow from right to call again when he is running this gel is also one of that Suarez players in the NBA islam activists who more about what ron or what wall and says more about Ryan james you know i was in new yorks is a good afternoon drive when colby essentially states to mutiny against mike and tony because they had tony system wasnt working with the lakers partly cause itll be a body in part because the roster was exactly right but call we know we had missed the playoffs that was it at the white tower in powder salt and steve nash and and they call this witness nice play also called me to o'gorman the office essentially where the point ignored and told me it is they wound up with a catastrophic get to read books laying them into the playoffs withdrawing james on all things here was speeding on you'll be withdrawn as to when what he had to send see left miami hers doing that they needed to david black pen to tie you wont its no not against those go to david blacks and goldstein who is a good coach i think what wall is a good coach but what brought seeks control is going to play it as much of the playoffs for better or worse in certain respects the young guys and all that the case may be tougher and the organization would like maybe not middleclass the veterans more than able to and as a result obese or development among young guys who knows mate listen luke Walton three dates no Bronte dates magic soul yes to be great to keep his job which is okay thats the way to standard you should have to be great to people lakers job with this says more about look ron because it was a state with black it was the same thing with time while this is what ron does he takes control of the team is a bathtub also bought benny trusts and self that skeleton of the small about luke Walton the small bomb will walk out of you get an idea like that i got to one who is considered the date yet this is more bout luke Walton them abroad is among them at that you want to baffle broadest away with the da will my ground david black molly's guys that is true but you also have to remember although we respect the griffin of former general manager for the cleveland cavaliers you still had did you what is the owner you still ahead on situation where it was low Braun it with a broad see this is the magic johnson see hers the president of basketball operations he did not high here luke Walton okay that was the bothans idea that obviously ive been told that magic have caught want it see what slow gone look his goal and its that simple Jeannie bluff or not stand in his wake up any bathtub or related matters here what does this love basketball was magic johnson makes the call here we are having said that youve watched relevant once upon a time with some of the embargo like to thank you know why its so its about Isabelle abroad but then i heard a broadly weeks ago weave got to hand it to Velma key rise on Rhonda all right michael Beasley lance the events in these Godwin epic love broad wanted them to live abroad of god everything he wanted a small without god Juana when they get what you want without that he doesnt want to be or not want want red tape the other would be off the racket ball on the racket whenever ive been told that brought him to stay clean away from all at the other want his name stayed in any way in case magic of the midst of this if it had mad dogs and as cognizant of that which is why luke Walton the stuff about bomb all book walter was a bomb like him but they are ranked twentieth ostensibly thats not acceptable to magic johnson benefits in terms of praise applied in the no by in thats not acceptable to magic johnson futile brought this about to turn thirty four years of age to buy this then in that you gonna make sure preserve him as some degree probably looking at all of those different things that ism saying to myself these are not things that dont work in luke Walton playbook especially when you have our brian went off and how does whining about how the broad james has ignored place at the peak of his rightful but then youve ignored plays that luke Walton is called to the point where luke Walton ultimately figured out as not call him a place that land abroad do what you wanted to give your magic johnson league play a flaw that riley and might die levy youre listening backing of their way to mend it mom and me for more than is now ism not going let him get sprained an american led him to pilloried because people beginning he got another call apply it ism not going to him and that was it should but at some point in time to get the things dont change the batter ism gonna make a call now dont want to just what the winning streak solano began Ahmad khan panic united what is right there was for both wanted but the maggots all magic is sensitive to that issue of course is a cap on west and fired and that way a championship golds in like the pace of blame at that shows will sign an adult rod anyone i know what an right whats the next magic johnson is is the next met michael jordan and magic in it and and say that baby was look writings high flying with no basketball genius of the passing of the court vision so so magic is sensitive to that issue was badly worn out west and or magic that was more about magic this is more about law and that is about and wall and this is what withdrawn dollars here why you may not want the reputation of coach taylor and i think coach killers too strong a year this is not the guy he had it so low he cannot just be a good coach which we know he is c was being a kuwait Colwell order to save it on hers a great one will save his job well i again ism not say that now mac or brought a go to law abiding forgive that makes it on saying that all this adds another result is something he in his teeth on kindness and all they want to avoid with somebody like magic johnson gonna be incredibly protective of this primary yes it was going on with the fact they see the war morning Michelle ism saying thats why the mob out Walton because magic johnson or the basketball le brocks ross magic johnson basketball activity better magic johnson come to the conclusion that we gonna do thought that this will be about wont be a bit about the amount of abroad remotely believable or wrong but really when i was embezzling over on what ism saying is a wall is incidental weather is it going around the head coach isnt even the issue as i said the only thing that saves him as if hers a great coach bob why seasons at least interchangeable nothing black anti wounded and everybody lies ahead of them at the body of knowledge about silver at about eight of the hawked about it that way who hit right and en s its not at him
